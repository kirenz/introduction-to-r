Learning to program in R is quite similar to learning a foreign language. And just as with learning any foreign language you need lots of practice to improve your skills. The purpose of this site is to provide you with helpful resources to get started learning R.\nNote that this overview mainly covers the use of a collection of R packages called the tidyverse, an ecosystem of packages designed with common APIs and a shared philosophy. An R package is simply a bundle of functions, documentation, and data sets. There are about 25 packages in the tidyverse and they are especially designed for data science and share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.\n\nGetting Started\nBefore we can start analyzing data in R, there are some key concepts you need to understand first (Ismay and Kim 2020):\nR & RStudio\nWhat are R and RStudio and how to install them?\n\nInstall a recent version of R and RStudio (Desktop Open Source License)\nRStudio Cloud\nIf you should have troubles installing R or RStudio on your machine you can also use RStudio Cloud at https://rstudio.cloud/.\nRStudio Cloud is a lightweight, cloud-based solution that allows you to use R and RStudio online. Choose the option Get Started for Free and create an account.\nCoding\nHow do I code in R?\nPackages\nWhat are R packages?\nInspect a dataset\nInspect a dataset\nTidyverse\nImport data\nBefore you can manipulate data with R, you need to import the data into R’s memory, or build a connection to the data that R can use to access the data remotely (Grolemund 2020):\nImport data\nProgramming\nProgram\nVisualize data\nVisualize data\nExploratory data analysis\nThis book chapter will show you how to use visualisation and transformation to explore your data in a systematic way, a task that statisticians call exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short (Wickham and Grolemund 2016):\nExploratory data analysis\nTransform data\nThe dplyr package is a part of the tidyverse and provides simple “verbs”, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate your thoughts into code:\nTransform data\nTidy data\nIn this chapter, you will learn a consistent way to organise your data in R, an organisation called tidy data (Wickham and Grolemund 2016):\nTidy data\nR Markdown\nR Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both save and execute code, and generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018):\n\n\n\nWhat is R Markdown? from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo.\n\nHow it works\nHow it works\nLearn Markdown\nMarkdown is a simple way to format text that looks great on any device. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type — just the essentials, using keyboard symbols you already know:\nLearn Markdown in 10 minutes\nKey concepts\nIn this book chapter, you learn some key concepts about R Markdown(Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020):\nR Markdown basics\nMore resources\n“Nice Teacup Giraffes and Stats” is a series of self-paced interactive statistics modules for beginners by Hasse Walum and Desirée De Leon.\n“Data Science in a Box” focuses on data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, inference, modelling, and effective communication of results (Çetinkaya-Rundel 2020).\n“Swirl” is an R package that helps you learn R from within R. It’s an interactive course that runs from your R console.\nAcknowledgments\nThis is a website made with the distill package.\n\n\n\nÇetinkaya-Rundel, Mine. 2020. “Data Science in a Box.” https://datasciencebox.org/.\n\n\nGrolemund, Garrett. 2020. “The Tidyverse Cookbook.” https://rstudio-education.github.io/tidyverse-cookbook/.\n\n\nIsmay, Chester, and Albert Y Kim. 2020.
