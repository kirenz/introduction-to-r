## Welcome  

The R programming language is a powerful open source tool for statistics, machine learning and data science. Learning to program in R is quite similar to learning a foreign language. And just as with learning any foreign language you need lots of practice to improve your skills. The purpose of this site is to provide you with helpful resources to get started learning R.
